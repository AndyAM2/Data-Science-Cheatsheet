**Update (2019-12-18)**: The *Data Science Cheatsheet* has evovled into a book! Check out *Cracking the Data Science Interview* [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/171068013X/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=cracking+the+data+science+interview&qid=1576688426&sr=8-8)! This also means that the Cheatsheet will be getting a makeover soon- stay tuned!

# Data Science Cheatsheet
This cheatsheet is currently a 9-page reference in basic data science that covers basic concepts in probability, statistics, statistical learning, machine learning, big data frameworks and SQL.

The cheatsheet is loosely based off of *The Data Science Design Manual* by Steven S. Skiena and *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.

Inspired by William Chen's *The Only Probability Cheatsheet You'll Ever Need*, located [here](https://github.com/wzchen/probability_cheatsheet).

## Future Additions
* Graph Theory
* Algorithms and Data Structures
* Python 
* Advanced SQL (SQL Part II)
* Data Science on the Cloud- AWS/GCP/Azure
* Linear Algebra
* Data Engineering
